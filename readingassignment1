Microservice might sound like the service is small, but we learn MSA is more about how it's packaged and deployed. 
We should aknowledge how each microservice is independent and has usually only one responsibility. 
Miniservice can have more than one service/feature unlike Microservices. 
I think the textbook gives a great breakdown to what benefits come with MSA: 
Agility, risk reductiom, distributed development, technology flexibility, scalability, resiliency 
Because of these benefits, many application software vendors lie about providing Mircoservices. 
Althought MSA can be very beneficial, we are told to think about adopting MSA. 
It can be costly and difficult to manage if the company is inexperienced.
